<P>
An introduction to formal ontology focusing on development and
implementation issues and contemporary ontology software tools and
languages. The ontology editor Protege will be used throughout and the
representation of ontologies in W3C semantic web languages RDF(S) and
OWL will be emphasized.

<DIV ID="INCLUSION"  class="SYLSEC">
<H2>
Statement of Inclusion
</H2>
<P>
The following expression is adopted from the Chancellor's
Commitment Statement of November 2012:
    
</P>
<P>
As the state's premier public university, the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign's core mission is to serve the interests of the
diverse people of the state of Illinois and beyond. The institution
thus values inclusion and a pluralistic learning and research
environment, one which we respect the varied perspectives and lived
experiences of a diverse community and global workforce. We support
diversity of world views, histories, and cultural knowledge across a
range of social groups including race, ethnicity, gender identity,
sexual orientation, abilities, economic class, religion, and their
intersections.
</P>
<DIV class="SYLSUBSEC">
<H3>
Inclusiveness as a topic in LIS590-OD
</H3>
<P>
The models and theories we cover in this class frame the way
we understand resources, our professional roles with respect to their
stewardship, and the access and preservation problems to which our
efforts are directed. Under the right circumstances they can help make
our services more inclusive, as we've seen, for example, with the
digital encoding of writing systems and attention to web content
accessibility issues. But knowledge organization systems can also
marginalize, as reforms of library subject and medical classifications
 have shown. The topics for our class meetings are
selected with the aim of encouraging reflection and discussion, but
those choices are not socially or culturally neutral. Where we may be
missing opportunities to align the class content and conduct with the
values expressed in the inclusion statement, students are encouraged
to call classmate and instructor attention to those issues.
</P>
</DIV>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="DISABILITY"  class="SYLSEC">
<H2>
Disability Statement
</H2>
<P>
To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary
aids, students with disabilities must contact the course instructor
and the Disability Resources and Educational Services (DRES) as soon
as possible. To contact DRES you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign,
call 217-333-4603 (V/TTY), or e-mail a message to disability@uiuc.edu.

</DIV>
  
<DIV ID="GRADING"  class="SYLSEC">
<H2>
Basis for Grading and Evaluation
</H2>
<P>
The most important standards for success in a class like this
one are the educational goals that students bring to the class. Your
instructor hopes that the activities, assignments, and presentations
planned for this semester will be instrumental in your achieving the
goals you set for yourself. Each exercise and assignment has been
selected to provide an experience that will foster your own learning.
Do not think that grading and evaluative feedback are meant as
assesments of your success or failure in the class: they are provided
as an incentive to engage with the material to the best of your
ability, and as a diagnostic, to find you're not getting the benefits
that the assignments should provide.
</P>
<P>
Final grades will be calculated as follows:
    
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Graded homework assignments 80%
</LI>
<LI>
Class Participation: 20%
</LI>
</UL>
<DIV ID="FEEBACK"  class="SYLSUBSEC">
<H3>
Evaluative and constructive feedback
</H3>
<P>
Students
      are entitled to both evaluative and constructive feedback on the
      assignments. Evaluative feedback reports how well a completed
      assignment satisfied the requirements for a grade.  Constructive
      feedback provides more detailed criticism of the work, and
      suggestions for improvement.
</P>
<P>
It is the policy in this
      class to provide evaluative feedback privately to students when
      an assignment is returned after grading. However, constructive
      feedback will be provided in a public forum (discussions in
      class or on message boards)

On Adapting the Work of Others
</H3>
<P>
Criteria for grading homework assignments include (but are
not limited to) creativity and the amount of original work
demonstrated in the assignment. However, students are permitted to use
and adapt the work of others, provided that the following guidelines
are followed:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Use of other people's material must not infringe the copyright
of the original author, nor violate the terms of any licensing
agreement. Know and respect the principles of fair use with respect to
copyrighted material.
</LI>
<LI>
Students must scrupulously attribute the original source and
author of whatever material has been adapted for the assignment.
Summarize (e.g. using source code comments) the changes or adaptations
that have been made. Make  plain how much of the assignment represents
original work.

Submitting Assignments to the Instructor

<P>
Create a syntactically valid RDF description of yourself
using the FOAF vocabulary, and any other RDF vocabularies that you
decide are useful for this assignment. Select a URI for yourself that
you are authorized to create and administer, such as one in a
web-accessible space where you are able to put resources online. 
</P>
<P>
Express the description in the turtle subset of the N3 RDF
serialization syntax, and use a validating parser of your choice to
confirm that what you have written is conforming RDF. Submit the
description along with a short description of any interesting
issues or difficulties you encountered and which parser or validation
service you used to check the syntax.

Publish an OWL vocabulary based on your domain analysis as

OWL Revision 1: Restrictions and inference

</P>
<P>
In the last assignment you defined individual instances as
part of your vocabulary to illustrate your property and class
definitions. For this assignment, propose an information management
strategy for your vocabulary that distinguishes between facts that
should be asserted and facts that should be deduced. For example, in
the current GSLIS ontology facts concerning job appointments are
asserted (appointee, appointing organization, job title), but status
as a GSLIS faculty member is deduced. Prepare and submit a written
explanation of your strategy. It should be between one half page and
one page in length.
</P>
<P>
Revise your vocabulary and your instance illustrations so
that when facts are asserted in accordance with your strategy, the
appropriate deduced facts are entailed by your class and property
definitions (just as with the illustrations included in gslis.ttl). I
will confirm the deductions using the Hermit plugin that accompanies
our Protege installation.
</P>
<P>
At least one of your class definitions should employ either
an owl:allValuesFrom (Allemang and Hendler, page 227) or an owl:someValuesFrom
(Allemang and Hendler, page 225) restriction. The remaining deductions can be
accomplished via as many or as few of the following as you wish:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
owl:allValuesFrom
</LI>
<LI>
owl:someValuesFrom
</LI>
<LI>
owl:hasValue

owl:inverseOf

<LI>
rdfs:range
</LI>
<LI>
rdfs:domain
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Post an announcement of your revision to the discussion
forum, and submit a copy of the revised vocabulary. The same validity
and linked data requirements apply as with Assignment 4: URIs for
entities in your schema should resolve to the URL for your
vocabulary's RDF, but you need not provide an html counterpart for
humans. One additional requirement is that in addition to being
syntactically valid, your vocabulary must be logically consistent.
That is to say, your declarations should not cause the Hermit reasoner
to report that your model is inconsistent.

Make one final revision to your OWL vocabulary, and
document it with 1-2 pages of natural language submitted along
with the RDF file. Make at least two changes or additions that make
your definitions better integrated with one or more classmates'
vocabularies. Aim for one change (to your vocabulary) that
accommodates the needs of someone else, and one change (to your
vocabulary) that makes it easier or possible for you to use
a classmate's vocabulary. Include at least two illustrative RDF
statements: one that uses instances of your classmate's OWL class and
one that uses a property imported from your classmate's
vocabulary.
