# Assignment 3: Domain analysis and proposal in natural language

This assignment is due ASGT3DUE. 

Prepare a written analysis of the domain you have chosen
that includes:

- Scope of the proposed area (1-2 pages)
- Relationships to definitions in our case study
  vocabulary (including things that should be there but aren't)
- Existing published vocabularies that are candidates
  for extension (FOAF, bibo, schema.org, etc.)
- Suggestive RDF fragments or illustrations using the example.com
  domain.
- Ideas for classes and properties.
