# Academic Integrity

Please review and reflect on the academic integrity policy of the University of Illinois,
<http://admin.illinois.edu/policy/code/article1_part4_1-401.html> to which we subscribe.
By turning in materials for review, you certify that all work presented is your own and
has been done by you independently, or as a member of a designated group for group assignments.
If, in the course of your writing, you use the words or ideas of another writer, proper
acknowledgment must be given (using APA, Chicago, or MLA style). Not to do so is to commit
plagiarism, a form of academic dishonesty. If you are not absolutely clear on what constitutes
plagiarism and how to cite sources appropriately, now is the time to learn. Please ask me!
Please be aware that the consequences for plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty
will be severe. Students who violate university standards of academic integrity are
subject to disciplinary action, including a reduced grade, failure in the course, and
suspension or dismissal from the University.

## On Adapting the Work of Others

Criteria for grading homework assignments include (but are not limited
to) creativity and the amount of original work demonstrated in the
assignment. However, students are permitted to use and adapt the work
of others, provided that the following guidelines are followed:

- Use of other people's material must not infringe the copyright of
  the original author, nor violate the terms of any licensing
  agreement. Know and respect the principles of fair use with respect
  to copyrighted material.

- Students must scrupulously attribute the original source and author
  of whatever material has been adapted for the assignment.  Summarize
  (e.g. using source code comments) the changes or adaptations that
  have been made. Make plain how much of the assignment represents
  original work.
