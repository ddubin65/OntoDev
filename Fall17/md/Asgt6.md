# Assignment 4: OWL Revision 2 and integration with other class vocabularies

This assignment is due ASGT6DUE. 

Make one final revision to your OWL vocabulary, and
document it with 1-2 pages of natural language submitted along
with the RDF file. Make at least two changes or additions that make
your definitions better integrated with one or more classmates'
vocabularies. Aim for one change (to your vocabulary) that
accommodates the needs of someone else, and one change (to your
vocabulary) that makes it easier or possible for you to use
a classmate's vocabulary. Include at least two illustrative RDF
statements: one that uses instances of your classmate's OWL class and
one that uses a property imported from your classmate's
vocabulary.
