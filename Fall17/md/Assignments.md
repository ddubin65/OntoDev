# Basis for Grading and Evaluation

The most important standards for success in a class like this
one are the educational goals that students bring to the class. Your
instructor hopes that the activities, assignments, and presentations
planned for this semester will be instrumental in your achieving the
goals you set for yourself. Each exercise and assignment has been
selected to provide an experience that will foster your own learning.
Do not think that grading and evaluative feedback are meant as
assesments of your success or failure in the class: they are provided
as an incentive to engage with the material to the best of your
ability, and as a diagnostic, to find you're not getting the benefits
that the assignments should provide.

Final grades will be calculated as follows:

- Graded homework assignments 90%
- Class Participation: 10%

## Evaluative and constructive feedback

Students are entitled to both evaluative and constructive feedback on
the assignments. Evaluative feedback reports how well a completed
assignment satisfied the requirements for a grade.  Constructive
feedback provides more detailed criticism of the work, and suggestions
for improvement.

It is the policy in this class to provide
evaluative feedback privately to students when an assignment is
returned after grading. However, constructive feedback will be
provided in a public forum (discussions in class or on message
boards)

## Submitting Assignments to the Instructor

All assignments must be submitted in machine
readable form.  The instructors will discuss detailed requirements for
file naming, packaging, and submission for each assignment.

## Graded Assignments

There will be six graded assignments:

- Conforming FOAF profile in Turtle/N3 (due ASGT1DUE).
- Serving linked data for humans and non-humans (due ASGT2DUE).
- Domain analysis and proposal in natural language (due ASGT3DUE).
- Class, subclass, and property definitions in OWL (due ASGT4DUE).
- OWL Revision 1: Restrictions and inference (due ASGT5DUE).
- OWL Revision 2, integration with other class vocabularies (due ASGT6DUE).

## Class Participation

The class participation grade is based on consistent
attendance, contribution to in-class and/or online discussions, and
providing assistance to classmates outside of class. Please alert the
instructor if a classmate has been of help to you outside of
class.
