# Assignment 1: Conforming FOAF profile in Turtle/N3

This assignment is due ASGT1DUE. 

Create a syntactically valid RDF description of yourself
using the FOAF vocabulary, and any other RDF vocabularies that you
decide are useful for this assignment. Select a URI for yourself that
you are authorized to create and administer, such as one in a
web-accessible space where you are able to put resources online. 

Express the description in the turtle subset of the N3 RDF
serialization syntax, and use a validating parser of your choice to
confirm that what you have written is conforming RDF. Submit the
description along with a short description of any interesting
issues or difficulties you encountered and which parser or validation
service you used to check the syntax.

Evaluation criteria for this assignment are based only on
technical and syntactic correctness, but your instructor will try to
provide feedback on semantic and social issues where appropriate.
