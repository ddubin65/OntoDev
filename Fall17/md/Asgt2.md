# Assignment 2: Serving linked data for humans and non-humans

This assignment is due ASGT2DUE. 

Publish the RDF description of yourself from assignment 1
at a web-accessible address, and make the URI denoting yourself work
according to linked data principles:

- An RDF validator directed to the URI should receive a syntactically
  correct RDF description.
- A Mozilla-compatible browser directed to the URI should receive an
  HTML page describing you.

You can change the URI  denoting yourself if you need to.
Submit a short written report on this assignment (1 page) that
includes the URI.
