# Assignment 4: Class, subclass, and property definitions in OWL

This assignment is due ASGT4DUE. 

Publish an OWL vocabulary based on your domain analysis as
linked data. URIs for any entity in your schema should resolve by
default to the URL for your RDF file in either turtle or rdf/xml. You
need not provide an html counterpart for humans, but do use annotation
properties like label and comment to document your definitions.

- Import the case study ontology and any others on which you wish to
  base subclasses or subproperties.

- Define range and domain constraints for the properties.

- Define individual instances for testing purposes, and
create property assertions for them that exercise each of your
properties at least once.

Confirm that your ontology can be loaded via a URI into
Protege. Submit the RDF source file and post the URI for your
vocabulary to the class forum.
