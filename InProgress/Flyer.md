# IS590-OD Ontology Development

## What will I learn in IS590-OD?

IS590-OD is an introduction to knowledge representation and
information management for distributed deductive information
systems. You'll learn analysis principles and metadata encoding
standards that allow linked application data to be distributed over
the Internet under the stewardship of cooperating stakeholders.

## Will the skills and knowledge covered in IS590-OD help me get a job? 

In ten years the IS590-OD course material will be mainstream
information systems design competencies that every information
professional will need to understand. For now job ads looking
for these skills use key words like "linked data" and "semantic web."
The two links below will show you recent examples of companies advertising
for people who know ontology development.

## What specific technologies are taught in IS590-OD?

1. The RDF-based OWL 2 DL Web Ontology Language including differences
   among the RL, QL, and EL profiles.
2. The Datalog declarative logic programming language. We'll use the
   [DES interpreter](http://des.sourceforge.net/) for our Datalog exercises.
3. The [Protégé ontology editor](https://protege.stanford.edu/) and
   the [HermiT](http://www.hermit-reasoner.com/) description logic
   reasoner.
4. One or more URL redirection methods appropriate to the current
   semester's project hosting requirements.

## How is ontology development different from relational database design?

Relational database management systems are suitable for applications
where all the data is under one organization's control and schemas can
be tightly coupled to that organization's specific needs. That was
true of most information management applications in the past, but
becomes less true every year. Looking forward, most digital
information management will be coordinated across institutional
boundaries, with responsibilities distributed among many cooperating
stakeholders. That calls for more powerful and more flexible data
definition and querying models than those offered by relational systems.

## How is ontology development different from other kinds of metadata encoding and taxonomy design?

Metadata descriptions have traditionally been assertions of facts
about resources in some kind of collection. They've typically been
expected to serve as "grist" for an information processing mill
controlled by programmers and software engineers. Ontology languages
like OWL let us encode the *meaning* of metadata and the rules
that govern its processing using robust and neutral forms of expression.
That enables information systems to be made more reliable and their data
kept under the control of users instead of programmers.

## What courses areuseful preparation for IS590-OD?

Ontology development has no course prerequisites. The classes most
useful as preparation for IS590-OD are IS561 Information Modeling and
IS562 Metadata in Theory and Practice. Any prior coursework on
deductive logic, database design, or programming in a high level
language will also help students get the most out of Ontology
Development.
